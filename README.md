# Simple Implementation of Promise in JavaScript

The implemention progress has been done step by step, and each step is accessible via the released tags.

The main purpose of creating this repository is to support the readers of the book that I have published named [Understanding the Core Ideas of Promise by Implementing it in JavaScript](https://github.com/Babak-Gholamzadeh/Understanding-the-Core-Ideas-of-Promise-by-Implementing-it-in-JavaScript), which enables them to download the final example at each section of the book.
